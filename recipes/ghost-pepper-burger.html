        <p><strong>Remember</strong>, this recipe is a Recipe for Disaster. There <em>will</em> be negative consequences if you do not read this carefully beforehand.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ghost pepper (bhut jolokia)</li>
            <li>slices of your cheese of choice (enough for 6 burgers)</li>
            <li>6 large burger buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix onion powder, salt, black pepper, and ghost pepper until combined.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and mix the spices into the meat.</li>
            <li>Divide the meat into six balls and form them into patties. Press together any cracks to avoid pieces breaking off while grilling.</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill to a high heat and add the patties. Close or cover with the lid.</li>
            <li>Flip when the top of the patties begin to turn to a slight shade of brown.</li>
            <li>Add cheese and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove patties from the grill to a plate. After a couple of minutes, transfer the patties to buns.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite toppings and enjoy the heat!</li>
            <li>For extra heat, touch your eye and face. Feel that burn? My god, why won't it stop? The tears...</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Don't want to see the world burn?</h3>
        <p>Oh, wait, the fire is in your eyes. The world is fine.</p>
        <p>Handling peppers, or foods, with high levels of capsicum requires thorough handwashing.</p>
        <p>When forming patties, wash your hands with plenty of soap and hot water to remove all traces of pepper. Alternatively, wear gloves.</p>
        <p>Also, burgers can be messy. Probably some grease or condiments got onto your hands with some ghostr pepper mixed in. Don't touch your face while eating and wash afterwards.</p>
