        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) salmon fillet</li>
            <li>freshly ground blakc pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/8 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>a plank of alder wood</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the fillet out of the freezer and let it thaw on the counter for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Soak the salmon in your preferred brine solution for at least 4 hours in the fridge to cure.</li>
            <li>Before heating up your grill, soak the alder wood plank in water for at lest 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill for 160 to 180 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Remove the fillet from the brine, rinse under cold running water, and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Remove the wood plank from water, place the salmon on the plank, and season the fillet with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the plank with salmon on the grill and smoke for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Check the fish every 1.5 hours. When your fish flakes with a fork, it's ready! (<em>Depending on the size of the fish, smoking may take up to 6 hours.</em>)</li>
            <li>Mix together the brown sugar and water to make a paste. Brush onto the fish for a sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your smoked salmon fillet! Within the next day, you should be feeling the effects of food poisoning! Good ol' smoked salmonella!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Prefer a more delightful experience?</h3>
        <p>Not everyone appreciates slowly consuming a slow-cooked meal and having it blast out the other end like Mt. Vesuvius. To each their own.</p>
        <p>To adjust this recipe, don't let your fish thaw for more than 2 hours outside of the fridge. This allows bacteria to grow.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the internal temperature of the fish should reach 140 degrees F to be considered thoroughly cooked. Kill all those pathogens.</p>
